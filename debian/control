Description: CPU feature checking - common back-end

 Set Architecture features such as SSE3. By refusing to install on machines
 lacking a required feature, they allow ISA requirements to be handled in
 terms of package dependencies.

 requirement, other packages can pre-depend on one of the individual
 feature-specific packages:

 armv6-support, armv7-support, armv8-support, vfp-support, vfpv2-support,
